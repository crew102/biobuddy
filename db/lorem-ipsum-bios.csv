**Interviewer:** Hi Mason! I heard you had a bit of a rough start—care to share your story? 

**Mason:** Oh, you know, same old tail—literally! I had a little mishap with my eye, but after a visit to the specialist, they decided I’d look even dashing with one eye instead of two. Talk about a ""one-eyed wonder,"" right?

You see … Natsu is deaf and he relies on his buddy Aki to be his ears. These sweeties are an adorable big purse duo weighing in at nearly 9 pounds and the other at 7. They do well with the puddle pads and we are working on teaching Natsu hand signals for stay… and come. Deaf dog history for adopting is a requirement as if you have never had a non hearing pup …. you won’t understand the strange and sharp bark that comes with not being able to hear themselves. Natsu isn’t terribly bad … but he’s known to hit a few opera notes when he sees something new and different. Please submit your application on our website for these two adorable babies. ? ",TRUE,"**Interview with Natsu & Aki: The Dynamic Duo!**

**Interviewer:** Welcome, Natsu and Aki! You two are quite the team. Any favorites among the duo?

**Natsu:** Oh, absolutely! Aki is my trusty sidekick. He’s like my personal translator, but instead of words, he uses his adorable little wiggles. I bark; he interprets!

**Aki:** Yep! When Natsu starts his opera concert, I jump in with a $5 scratch-and-sniff! Honestly, he just sings like nobody's business when he sees new things. It’s like a Poodle version of ""America’s Got Talent!""

**Interviewer:** Natsu, what’s it like being a deaf dog?

**Natsu:** It’s a blast! I live in my own world of cuteness. I just channel all my energy into hand signals. And let's be honest, my barking might sound odd, but it's a strong part of my charm.

**Interviewer:** What’s your favorite pastime together?

**Aki:** Exploring! I lead the way while Natsu checks everything out with his ‘paws-and-sniff’ technique. And do you know how hard it is to find good puddle pads? We’re practically experts now.

**Natsu:** And when it’s cuddle time? That's when I shine! I could snuggle forever!

**Interviewer:** Last thoughts for potential adopters?

**Natsu:** If you’re ready for some mischievous fun and a few major talents—like my surprise opera debut—then we’re the pups for you!

**Aki:** Plus, you’ll learn a thing or two about doggy sign language! Ready to adopt the ultimate tag team? Don't forget to toss in a few treats!","Hey there, fabulous humans! I’m Natsu, your friendly neighborhood Poodle (with a twist of opera flair!), and I’m here to introduce my sidekick, Aki, the coolest Yorkie mix you’ll ever meet. Together, we’re a dynamic duo you didn’t know you needed in your life—think Batman and Robin, but much fluffier and cuter! 

Now, I may be the one who's a bit hard of hearing (don’t worry, Aki is my trusty ears), but what I lack in sound, I make up for in personality! I communicate through flashy movements and, of course, my award-winning bark that sometimes sounds like I’m auditioning for a musical! You might even say I've got a bit of an operatic range when I see something super interesting—the neighbors are going to love me! 

We’re both pretty compact, weighing in at a combined total of just 16 pounds—perfect for pocket-sized adventures or curling up in your big purse! And don’t worry about those potty accidents; we’re solid experts on the potty pads! Together, we're on a mission to master some hand signals, so get ready for your own personal doggy charm school!

Now, a little heads up: if you’ve never had a non-hearing pup before, I’d recommend you do your homework! We’re looking for a special human (or human family) who gets all the little quirks that come with a deaf dog because trust me, you'll want to embrace my fabulous barks!

**Introducing the Stars:** Natsu, a charming 3.5-year-old Poodle weighing in at 9 lbs, and his loyal partner Aki, a delightful 1.5-year-old Yorkie mix at 7 lbs. These two are inseparable and share a bond that’s simply heartwarming.

**Natsu’s Special Superpower:** Though Natsu is deaf, he navigates the world with the help of Aki, who acts as his trusty companion. This adorable duo is not only cute but also a testament to the incredible bond between dogs!

**Harmonious Living:** They’re doing great with puppy pads and are learning together—currently focusing on hand signals for commands like “stay” and “come.” A little background in adopting deaf dogs is essential; understanding their unique vocalizations, including the occasional high note (opera-style!), is part of the package!

**Adoption Requirements:** Natsu and Aki thrive in a home that recognizes the beauty of their bond and is equipped to support Natsu’s unique needs. If you have prior experience with a hearing-impaired pup, you’ll appreciate the joys and quirks that come with Natsu!

He was adopted when he was still very young. Unfortunately he was found roaming the street several months later. We make a commitment to ALWAYS take our pets back. He came back to us over a year ago and has been here ever since. He loves people and attention. He is super playful, but can play too rough if allowed. His favorite game is tug of War. His favorite toy is a stuffed unicorn. He is selective about other dogs and has not been cat tested. He likes kids, but due to his size and playful personality we recommend children over 10. He is a large, healthy boy weighing in at around 70 pounds. He enjoys running, playing with toys, rolling in his play yard, playing tug of war, and sleeping. He also loves the water hose. He dances for the water hose on a hot day. He walks very well on a leash, keeps a clean kennel, is up to date on vaccines, and is neutered. He is a volunteer favorite. He is an absolute goofball. Donnie is a big boy who loves to play! He was adopted as a puppy but returned when his family moved and couldn't take him with them. He does like other dogs, but can be selective.

**Interviewer:** Welcome, Donnie! With a backstory like yours, you’ve got quite the tale. How’d you end up back here?

**Donnie:** Well, let’s just say my first family thought they could take the big guy on the road. I love adventure, but they couldn’t take me along when they moved. Sad face, right? But I'm back! 

**Interviewer:** And what have you been up to since your grand return?

**Donnie:** Oh, just perfecting my tug-of-war technique! I’m a champion, you know. And I’ve got this adorable stuffed unicorn that I take everywhere — we’re best buds.

**Interviewer:** A unicorn, really? That’s pretty unique! What’s your favorite game besides tug-of-war?

**Donnie:** Anything that involves running and the water hose! You should see me dance for it on hot days. I’m basically a water ballet superstar!

**Interviewer:** And how about your interactions with dogs and kids?

**Donnie:** I’m a selective friend with dogs — gotta keep it classy. As for kids, I love them! Just recommend ages 10 and up; I wouldn’t want my roughhousing to knock over any tiny humans.

**Interviewer:** What’s your ideal day like, big guy?

**Donnie:** Oh, it’s simple: play hard, nap harder, then repeat! Did I mention I’m up to date on all my shots and ready to find my forever home? Who could resist this goofy charm?

**Interviewer:** Well, the world needs more Donnies in it! Anyone interested can find you on Saturdays?

**Donnie:** Yup! Swing by, and let’s make some memories together. Don’t forget the unicorn!","Hey there, hooman! The name’s Donnie - the big guy with a heart as large as my 70-pound frame! Let me tell you, life has thrown me some curveballs, but I'm here to snag your heart and never let it go. I was adopted as a tiny furball but ended up back with my peeps after some unexpected life changes. No hard feelings— I'm just happy to be here, soaking up love and attention like the playful goofball I am!

Now let's get to the fun stuff! I’m a playful party animal, with tug-of-war as my crown jewel game. My secret weapon? A plush unicorn that I treat like royalty! I do love a good romp, but I can get a bit *rough and tumble* if you let me. Fair warning - kids over 10 would probably have the best time with my exuberant spirit!

Water? Oh boy, do I adore the hose! On hot days, I turn into a dancing dynamo, twirling around in pure bliss as the cool water spritzes me. If you need a home swim buddy, I’m your pup! 

I'm a well-mannered gentleman on a leash - walks are my jam! I keep my kennel nice and clean too, because that’s just how I roll. I might need a little refresher on my house training (puppy brain from when I was a tiny tot, ya know), but I’m ready to learn!

I beam like a star at the shelter, where I’m the favorite of volunteers - they can’t resist my goofy charm. I may be selective when it comes to furry siblings, but I’m pretty great with humans and I’m all ears for meet and greets with other pups!

While he enjoys the company of other dogs, he can be selective, and he has not been tested with cats.

**Family Fit:** Donnie loves kids, but we recommend a household with children over the age of 10, as his size and spirited play style can be overwhelming for little ones. His ideal home would appreciate his goofy demeanor and provide him with ample playtime and cuddle breaks.

- He walks beautifully on a leash and maintains a clean kennel.

**Interviewer:** Fiercely loyal, I see! What does that mean in your world?

**Dean:** It means I’m the bodyguard you've always dreamed of! I’ll protect my people and our territory like a pro. Just try sneaking up on us! Spoiler alert: it won’t end well for you… unless you bring treats!

**Interviewer:** Treats, huh? What kind of family are you looking for?

**Dean:** I’m on the search for an experienced dog-loving family. Kids? Not my jam. They’re too wiggly and loud! I prefer those who appreciate my cuddly side and know how to handle my protective instincts.

**Interviewer:** You’ve got the essentials covered—neutered, microchipped, and all your vaccinations! What’s next for you?

**Dean:** World domination! Just kidding. I’m really just looking for my forever home where I can cuddle, protect, and be the good boy I know I am.

**Interviewer:** Any final words for potential adopters?

Just think of me as your very own furry lap dog—yes, I believe I’m the perfect size to fit right on your lap, *ahem*! 

I’m all about loyalty and love, but let’s be real—I also have a reputation as the loyal guardian of my turf. If you need a canine bodyguard who’s also a cuddly teddy bear, I’m your guy! That said, I prefer a home free of tiny humans, as my protective nature is best suited for grown-ups who understand my charm.

Imagine a chic handbag with fur, four legs, and an adorable wet nose—yep, that's Prada. While her siblings strutted off to their forever homes ages ago, Prada has been patiently waiting for someone to notice her irresistible charm. For a whopping 18 months, she played the waiting game, until one of our fabulous volunteers decided enough was enough and took Prada home for a foster adventure on June 29th. Prada’s got this whole “shy and mysterious” vibe going on. After all, she spent over a year at the shelter with not much more than doggie daydreams to keep her company. She’s still figuring out this whole “home life” thing—everything from the mystical box with moving pictures (TV) to the magical doggie door that she mastered in just 24 hours. Yes, you read that right, she’s a pro at zooming in and out! Outdoor time? Prada's all over it! She’s so outdoorsy that she’s turned dining al fresco into an art form. Seriously, she refuses to eat indoors. She loves running around, playing with toys, and chasing balls. But beware: her enthusiasm for tasting everything means her playtime needs a little supervision. Despite her love for the great outdoors, Prada is not exactly a fan of her crate. She’s more of a free spirit, but don’t worry, she’s house trained like a pro. With some bells and whistles (literally), she hasn’t had a single accident at her foster home. Now, let’s get real for a second. Prada’s not going to leap into your arms and shower you with instant affection. She’s way too classy for that. She’s looking for someone who’ll earn her trust and love. If you’re up for giving this girl the time and patience she needs to feel safe and adored, Prada will reward you with a bond that’s absolutely worth the wait. So, are you ready to welcome Prada into your life? She’s waiting for her runway moment—ready to strut her way into your heart! ----------------------------------------------------------------, the pup who’s been living the shelter life since December 2022! She came here as a tiny furball with her mom and three siblings. While her family strutted off to their forever homes, Prada’s been holding down the fort at the shelter, waiting for her big break. Now, here’s the thing about Prada – she’s a bit of a wallflower. Since she’s spent most of her days at the shelter, she’s a tad shy around new folks. And, full disclosure, she’s got some anxiety quirks. Prada’s crate? It’s a no-blanket zone because this girl thinks blankets are a gourmet snack. One bite, and it’s straight to Blockage City! But let’s talk about her good side. Prada’s a leash-walking pro and an absolute cuddlebug with the regular volunteers. Newcomers? She’s like, “Who are you, and why are you in my bubble?” Give her some time, though, and she’ll be showering you with love and tail wags. Prada’s top hobby? Playing with her shelter buddies and her giant ball – it’s her jam! So, if you’re up for giving this sweet, quirky girl the chance she deserves, Prada’s adoption application is just a click away! Adopt Prada today, and let the adventures begin! ",FALSE,"**Meet Prada: The Chic Canine Fashionista!**

**Interviewer:** Welcome, Prada! You’re quite the trendsetter, aren't you?

**Prada:** Oh darling, if a handbag could strut its stuff, I’d be it! With my fur and fabulousness, I’m basically the fifth Beatle of bags. 

**Interviewer:** You’ve been at the shelter for quite a while! How’s that been for you?

**Prada:** Let’s just say I’m the last one at the fashion show, but I’ve been working my runway pose! It’s a tad boring, but I’ve been dreaming about a luxurious home with lots of treats.

**Interviewer:** So, what do you think about your new foster adventure?

**Prada:** Total game changer! I’m still figuring out this “home life” thing. The mystical TV box? It’s like magic! And I became a doggy door ninja in less than a day. 

**Interviewer:** Any outdoor aspirations?

**Prada:** Oh honey, I’m an outdoor connoisseur! Dining al fresco was my first order of business. Indoors? No thanks—who wants to eat inside when you can enjoy the sun?

**Interviewer:** I hear you have a quirky relationship with your crate.

**Prada:** *Sigh* Yes, blankets are delicious little imposters, and I’m convinced they’re a culinary masterpiece. But no accidents here! I’m house-trained like a runway model on a schedule.

**Interviewer:** How do you feel about new people?

**Prada:** Adorable wallflowers need a bit of time! No whirlwind romances for me; I’m looking for someone who will understand my glamorous, reserved side. 

**Interviewer:** Any last words for potential adopters?

**Prada:** Let’s make this a partnership worth waiting for! With patience, I’ll give you a bond that radiates elegance. Ready to make my runway dreams come true? Let’s strut into the future together!","Hey, fabulous humans! Fancy meeting you here—I'm Prada, your next chic accessory, and no, I don’t come in a box. I’m more like that perfect designer handbag that has fur, four legs, and a downright adorable wet nose! While my siblings strutted off to their forever homes ages ago, yours truly has been patiently waiting for her moment to shine for a whopping 18 months! Can you believe it? I mean, talk about a delayed fashion show!

Since a kind soul decided enough was enough and took me out for a foster adventure on June 29th, I'm starting to embrace my inner diva! I’ve got this mysterious vibe going on because, let’s be honest, a year in the shelter gave me more time to perfect my wallflower persona than to strut my stuff. But don’t worry; I’ve already mastered the magical doggie door in just 24 hours! Outdoor time is my runway—I'm so into dining al fresco that I flat-out refuse to eat indoors. Take that, four walls!

While I love to frolic, chase balls like they’re the last piece of bacon, and play with toys, my enthusiasm for tasting everything means I need a trusty sidekick during playtime. And about my crate? Let’s just say I’m a free spirit! A little too much of a gourmet when it comes to blankets, if you know what I mean. But I am potty trained like the superstar I am—no accidents here, just some fancy jingle bells when I need to go out!

Now, fair warning: I’m not going to leap into your arms like a hyper puppy. No, too classy for that! I’m looking for someone who’ll charm their way into my heart—earn my trust with patience, and, boy, will I reward you with a tail wagging extravaganza! So, if you’re ready to embrace a chic companion with quirks and make-believe adventures, I think we’ll be a match made in pet heaven!

**Personality:** Prada embodies the essence of a shy wallflower with an air of sophistication. After spending a significant amount of time at the shelter, she brings a touch of mystery to her charm. With her recent foster adventure beginning on June 29th, she’s embracing the “home life” experience and has quickly mastered her new surroundings, including the fascinating world of TV and even a magical doggie door!

**Outdoor Enthusiast:** This outdoor-loving diva has turned dining al fresco into her personal art form, insisting on enjoying her meals outside. Whether it’s chasing toys, zooming after balls, or basking in the sun, Prada is always ready for an adventure. Just a little note: her curiosity might get her into a bit of mischief during playtime, so some supervision is encouraged.

**House Trained:** While she enjoys being free-spirited, Prada has proven to be house trained like a pro. With a few clever cues (literally), she has yet to have an accident in her foster home, showcasing her potential as a well-mannered housemate.

**Building Trust:** True to her classy demeanor, Prada isn’t one to leap into your arms for instant affection. She prefers to take her time, looking for someone patient enough to earn her trust and love.

**Interviewer:** It must have been tough. What helps you warm up to people?

**Sunshine:** Just a little patience! Once I know you’re ‘paw-sitive’ vibes only, I transform into a big ol’ love bug. You should see me spreading the affection! 

**Interviewer:** I hear you love adventures. What's your favorite pastime?

**Sunshine:** Rides and hikes! Wind in my fur, tail wagging, and the occasional squirrel chase... who could resist? But don't be surprised if I flop down on the couch after and demand cuddles while we binge-watch TV. 

**Interviewer:** You’re quite the laid-back gal! How do you feel about kids, dogs, and even cats?

**Sunshine:** They’re all part of my fan club! Kid-friendly? Check. Dog-friendly? Double-check. And as for cats? They’ve got a funny way of surprising me, but I’m cool with it!

I’m also a road trip enthusiast and hiking aficionado! If you’ve got a car, I’ll jump right in because adventure awaits!

I’m a laid-back gal who gets along with everyone—kids, dogs, and even cats! I’m like the peace ambassador of the animal kingdom. Oh, and did I mention I’m a leash-walking superstar? You haven't truly experienced a stroll until you've taken one with me!

**Interviewer:** Tell us a bit about your personality.

- **Charming Conversationalist**: He can become quite the chatterbox when he desires attention, and who could possibly resist that adorable face?

Since then, he's bravely undergone an amputation and is waiting for another surgery (completely covered by us as part of adoption). Despite his challenges, Earl's spirit remains unbroken. He enjoys his time outside, even in a small kennel, and adores running and playing (must be limited as he still needs another surgery).

Despite her challenges, Kaylee was a pro at crate training and potty training—no accidents on her watch! She was as sweet as can be and got along famously with big dogs, though her enthusiasm sometimes led to rambunctious play that left the little ones bewildered. Kaylee was a quick learner when it came to hand signals—she knew ""no/leave it,"" ""sit,"" and ""come"" like the back of her paw. Her leash manners were a work in progress, driven by pure puppy exuberance. Gone were the days of chewing furniture; Kaylee had mastered the art of finding bones instead. She was even learning to settle on her place—a true sign of growing up. Despite being deaf, Kaylee’s spirit was boundless. With her love for life and endless determination, anyone would be lucky to have her as a furry family member. If you’re ready for a bundle of joy who's as unique as she is adorable, Kaylee is waiting to wiggle her way into your heart and home! Our adoption package includes: spay/neuter (when age appropriate) microchip full vetting (including up to date vaccinations & deworming) ",FALSE,"**A Pawsitive Chat with Kaylee, the Firecracker**

**Interviewer:** Hello, Kaylee! You’ve got quite the nickname – ""little firecracker."" Care to elaborate?

**Kaylee:** Oh, you bet! I’m not just any firecracker; I’m a spectacular show! Sure, I’m sight-impaired and deaf, but that just means I’m like a superhero – my other senses are on high alert! Plus, I’ll never hear those pesky doorbells!

**Interviewer:** Impressive! I hear you’re already on the potty training honor roll. How’d you manage that?

**Kaylee:** It's simple! Crates are cozy, and I’m all about keeping my space tidy. No accidents here, just a sparkling reputation! 

**Interviewer:** How do you interact with other dogs?

**Kaylee:** Big dogs? Bring them on! I’m all about that playful energy! The little ones might get a bit dizzy from my wild antics, but hey, who doesn’t love a twirl now and then?

**Interviewer:** And what about training? How's that going?

**Kaylee:** Oh, I’m a star pupil! Hand signals? I’ve got 'em down! “No” and “Sit” are like my secret handshakes. Just don’t ask me about leash manners yet… I might just perform my catchy puppy dance!

**Interviewer:** You’ve come a long way. What’s next on your list of accomplishments?

**Kaylee:** I’m mastering the fine art of chilling out—finding my “place” like a pro! And I’ll trade in the furniture for tasty bones any day.

**Interviewer:** A last word for your future family?

**Kaylee:** If you’re looking for an unstoppable bundle of joy that’ll fill your home with laughter, I’m ready to wiggle my way into your heart! Let’s embark on this adventure together! Plus, the adoption package is pretty epic – you get me, spayed and vetted like a superstar! Are you in?","Hey there, future human! I'm Kaylee, the pint-sized dynamo with a heart that’s bigger than my antics! Now sure, I might not hear the doorbell (or any bells, for that matter) and my vision is a bit fuzzy, but that just means I rely on my pawsome personality to get my point across! 

You better believe I am a potty training superstar—no embarrassing accidents here on my watch! I can handle my crate like a true champion, too! My charm even wins over the big dogs, although I’ll admit, occasionally my exuberance might leave the little ones a bit “what just happened?” (In my defense, I just love playing!)

I’m a quick study when it comes to hand signals—“No/leave it,” “sit,” and “come” are all part of my puppy lexicon. However, I’m still a work in progress when it comes to leash manners (what can I say? I just get sooo excited about the world!). Chewing on furniture? Pfft, that’s for rookies! I’ve graduated to finding bones, thank you very much. Oh, and I’m learning how to chill out on my designated spot—adulting is a journey, you know! 

Even though the world is a bit quieter for me, my spirit dances louder than fireworks on the Fourth of July! I might be little, but I promise my joy and determination will light up your life like a thousand glittering stars. If you're ready to welcome a lovable ball of energy and quirks into your home, I’m here just waggin’ my tail waiting for you! Ready for a furry bundle of joy that’s as unique as a snowflake?

**Pawsitive Traits:**
- **Crate & Potty Prodigy**: Kaylee excels in crate training and has mastered potty training, boasting an impressive record of zero accidents!

- **Leash Enthusiasm**: While her leash manners are still a work in progress, her pure puppy energy makes every outing an exciting adventure.
- **Chew Toy Connoisseur**: Say goodbye to furniture destruction—Kaylee has traded chewing shoes for digging up delightful bones!

I’ve made some great friends at my foster home—lots of other pups who get my silly antics—but I’m excited to meet your furry family too! Just a heads up, though: before I officially join the family, we’ll need to have a little meet and greet to make sure everyone vibes well together.

At just 9 weeks old, these pint-sized furballs are buzzing with enough puppy energy to power a small city. Their superhero origin story begins during a thunderstorm when a kind-hearted stranger found them in a box, soaking wet, flea-covered, and looking like they'd just auditioned for a disaster movie. After a gourmet meal of kibble and a spa day involving two luxurious Dawn dish soap baths, they emerged flea-free and fabulously clean. Once dried and fed, they conked out in a way only pups who know they’re safe can. With a hint of Sheltie sophistication, Seven and Eleven are adorably tiny. Seven, the daintier damsel, sports a sleek coat, while Eleven, the fluffier fella, looks like he's permanently plugged into a wind machine.

Her journey hasn't been easy-she was on her third owner and struggled to adjust to an active lifestyle of camping, canoeing, and constantly meeting new people. It's no wonder that such a young dog, with three different homes and no consistency or structure, would face behavioral challenges. Since arriving at DRU, Shotzie has made remarkable progress under the care of our dedicated staff. She now walks well on a leash, enjoys playing with a resident male Doberman friend, and loves chasing her jolly ball around the yard. While she meets new staff members cautiously, she soon warms up and makes friends. Unfortunately, Shotzie is often overlooked due to her German Shepherd mix, which makes her look a bit different from the typical Doberman. Shotzie dreams of finding a forever home with humans who understand her hesitation with new people and are willing to continue providing the structure and consistency she has come to thrive on at the shelter. Stealing this pretty girl's heart will require several meet and greets, but the reward of her love and loyalty will be well worth the effort. ",TRUE,"**Spotlight Interview with Shotzie: The Undercover Sweetheart**

**Interviewer:** Welcome, Shotzie! Let’s talk about your journey. What has it been like for you?

**Shotzie:** Oh, boy! Let’s say my life’s been a bit like an uncoordinated game of musical chairs. Three different owners by just over a year? I almost set a record! Structure? What's that?

**Interviewer:** What would you say to those looking at you and seeing a German Shepherd mix?

**Shotzie:** A mix? More like a unique recipe! I’m like a delightful stew—just different flavors! The best things come in unexpected packages, right?

**Interviewer:** So, how's life at DRU transformed you?

**Shotzie:** I’ve learned the fine art of leash-walking—no more tangled messes! I can also play a mean game of chase the jolly ball with my Doberman buddy. Who knew fun could be so active?

**Interviewer:** Any words for future humans considering you?

**Shotzie:** Patience is key, my friend. I might take a moment to check you out first. I’m like the cautious cat of dogs—except with less fluff and more snuggles! A couple of meet-and-greets? Bring it on! Nothing makes me happier than finding my forever humans.

**Interviewer:** What’s your dream home like?

**Shotzie:** A cozy den with lots of adventures ahead, plus some humans who know that getting to my heart is like earning a gold star—totally worth it! And snacks. Lots of snacks!","Hi there, future cuddle buddy! I'm Shotzie, and I'd like to think of myself as a diamond in the ruff! My life has been a bit of a roller coaster, three owners before I even hit my second birthday—talk about a busy doggo! But don't worry, my past is just a prologue to my exciting story!

We're talking about an adventure girl here! Sure, I might have hesitated at first when it comes to the whole camping and canoeing scene—new people walking around everywhere can be quite the mystery! But I’m slowly starting to see that humans aren’t all that scary, and even if I’m cautious at first, I warm up quicker than a doggie treat in the microwave!

Since joining DRU, I've become quite the superstar. I’ve mastered the art of leashed walks and transformed into a playful pup who loves to chase my jolly ball around. It’s basically my Olympic sport! And don't even get me started on my playdates with my Doberman buddy—yeah, we definitely know how to have fun! 

Now, I may have some of that German Shepherd flair, but I promise I’ve got the heart of a Doberman! My dream is to find a forever home where my humans get that I need a little time to adjust and know how to give me the love and structure I thrive on. A few meet-and-greets might be in order, but I swear the reward of my loyalty and love is worth the wait!

So, what do you say? Let’s embark on this adventure together and find our happy ending! 🐾❤️","🌟 **Introducing Shotzie: The Resilient Beauty!** 🌟

**Background:** Shotzie joined the DRU family in 2021 after being surrendered at just over a year old. With a history of three homes, her journey has been anything but easy. Transitioning to an active lifestyle filled with adventures like camping and canoeing proved challenging for this sweet girl, leading to some behavioral hurdles that stem from a lack of consistency and support.

**Transformation Journey:** Since arriving at DRU, Shotzie has blossomed under the care of our devoted staff. She’s now a pro on the leash, enjoys playful antics with her resident Doberman buddy, and has discovered the joy of chasing her favorite jolly ball around the yard. Though she approaches new people cautiously, her warm heart soon shines through as she forms connections.

**A Unique Gem:** While Shotzie may not fit the typical look of a Doberman due to her German Shepherd mix, her distinct appearance reflects her unique spirit and charm. Unfortunately, this can lead to her being overlooked, but she’s ready to show the world her true self!

**Home Sweet Home:** Shotzie dreams of a loving forever home where humans understand her initial hesitation and are dedicated to providing the structure and consistency that she thrives on. She will require several meet-and-greet sessions for her to build trust, but the reward of her unwavering loyalty and affection will be well worth the effort.

Like many dogs in this situation, Howard perhaps perceived himself as the ""baby"" of the family and reacted as a jealous older sibling when a human child arrived. Despite their year-long wait and hope for Howard's adjustment, he regrettably became more challenging to live with. He began marking the baby's belongings, defending furniture, and intensifying his territorial behavior. The choice to rehome him through DRU was a heavy one for his former family, who initially welcomed him as a lifelong member. In the early days here, Howard appeared confused and slow to trust. However, as he's settled in, we've witnessed his affectionate side slowly emerging. Once he warms up to a new human friend, Howard becomes highly enthusiastic and responsive. A simple offering of a hot dog elicits swift obedience and eye contact that grows softer and more trusting with each passing day. While he may still assess your credentials upon your first meeting, he's becoming a bit more welcoming to new members of ""Club Howard."" In the kennel, Howard is often found snuggled up in his favorite comforter, yet he'll eagerly spring into action for quality time with his beloved humans. Howard remains a work in progress. What we've discovered is that he would thrive in a quiet ""homebody"" lifestyle with a fenced yard. We regretfully cannot recommend him for a household with kids, cats, or other dogs at this time. ",TRUE,"**Sit Down with Howard: The Canine Comedian of Rehoming**

**Interviewer:** Hey there, Howard! You've had quite a journey to get here. Care to share?

**Howard:** Oh, absolutely! Picture this: I’m the superstar of the family, on top of the world, and then... BAM! A human baby arrives. Talk about a plot twist, right? Suddenly, I'm not just Howard, I’m akin to a jealous sibling.

**Interviewer:** That sounds pretty tough! How did you handle the new competition?

**Howard:** Let’s just say I tried to remind everyone who the real “baby” is around here—spoiler alert: it’s me! Marking a few things here and there... just my way of saying, “Hey, this spot's taken!”

**Interviewer:** And then you wound up with DRU, right?

**Howard:** Yep! Confusion? Check. Trust issues? Double-check. But once we got to know each other and they dangled a hot dog in my direction? Oh boy, did I turn into a lovebug! Nothing says “friendship” like a tasty treat.

**Interviewer:** So what’s your dream home?

**Howard:** A chill spot! Think a cozy couch, treats galore, and a yard for zoomies—no kiddo chaos, please! Just me, my human besties, and maybe a nice sunny nap in my favorite comforter.

**Interviewer:** Any words for prospective adopters?

**Howard:** Join Club Howard, and I promise loyalty like you've never seen. Just remember, it may take time, but once I trust you, it’s all hot dogs and happy snuggles from there! Ready to give a misunderstood pup a chance? Let's rock this “homebody” thing together!","Hey there, future human! I’m Howard, and believe me when I say, I’ve got more personality than a soap opera star! My journey has taken me from a cozy home where I was the “baby” to a little bit of a role reversal (but hey, I'll always be young at heart!). When a new baby came along, it turns out I became a jealous older sibling—who knew my fur would get ruffled? My former family looked for the best for everyone, and here I am, ready to find a new adventure with you!

Sure, I might have tried to mark my territory like a furry little king defending his castle, but let’s face it: I’m a sensitive guy at heart, just looking for some love and understanding. Yes, I might take a minute to size you up at first, but give me a chance, and you’ll see my affectionate side shine brighter than a diamond! A hot dog? Oh boy, you can bet I’ll be your best friend in no time! 

I love cozying up in my favorite comforter like a burrito on a chilly day, but I really spring into action for some quality time with my favorite humans. Just know that I’m a bit of a homebody—I thrive in a quiet area where I can be your one and only. I’m not really fond of sharing my kingdom just yet, so I’d do best in a home without kids, cats, or other furry friends (all the love for me, please!).

So, if you’re looking for a loyal companion who is working on the whole social scene and would love a warm home with a fenced yard, I’m your guy! Are you ready to join “Club Howard”? I promise, I'll make your heart smile! 🐾❤️","🐾 **Introducing Howard: The Gentle Soul in Search of a Forever Home** 🐾

**Background Story:** Howard's journey has been a poignant one. He was lovingly welcomed into a family who adored him as their ""baby."" Unfortunately, as life changed with the arrival of a new human child, Howard struggled to adjust, exhibiting behaviors that stemmed from jealousy and territoriality. After a year of hope and effort, it became clear that he would thrive in a different environment, leading to the difficult decision to rehome him through DRU.

**Personality:** Initially a bit hesitant and uncertain, Howard has gradually unwrapped his affectionate nature since arriving at our shelter. Once he feels comfortable, he reveals a joyful and responsive spirit. A simple treat like a hot dog can transform his demeanor, sparking immediate obedience and softening his gaze. Although he may size you up during your first encounter, with time and patience, he opens up to become a member of ""Club Howard.""

**Living Arrangements:** Howard flourishes in a cozy environment where tranquility reigns. A fenced yard and a ""homebody"" lifestyle are ideal for him, allowing his true personality to shine. However, he would not be suitable for homes with children, cats, or other dogs at this time.

**Fun Facts:** Found nestled in his favorite comforter, Howard treasures quality time with his favorite humans. As he continues to build trust and confidence, he reveals layers of charm that make him a truly special companion.

**Adoption Needs:** This loving boy is on the lookout for a patient and understanding family who can help him continue his journey of growth. If you're ready to welcome Howard into your life and provide him with the quiet, loving home he deserves, we invite you to submit an application today! 🏡💙"

King's blue coat is in fairly good condition although he does have a couple of lumps and bald spots, most likely pressure sores that will hopefully improve once he's in a comfortable castle of his own. Transferred from a shelter in New Jersey, King was originally turned in to them by an owner who reported that he was fighting with another dog in the house. Although we have no other details from his original home, the NJ shelter confirmed that King's intolerance of other dogs was real. They sent him to DRU in order to help him find Dobe-savvy owners through our program. King is a very big, rough and tumble guy. Sometimes it seems as though he'd picked up some of the traits of the bully breeds who were his most common kennelmates at the other shelter: he is very happy to carry his toys around, he loves his people enthusiastically and then there's that ""not cool with other dogs thing. Perhaps he has taken his name too literally all this time and feels the need to go forth and conquer? We think King would thrive in a home where his owners would respect his opinions without allowing him to express them. In other words, King needs to be an only dog in an adults-only home and owned by people who are willing to continue training him and teaching him to keep those opinions to himself. As is the case with the majority of adult male Dobermans, King is not a daycare/dog park/puppy party guy. He needs and deserves an owner who will provide him with both the structure of training and the fun of a work/play relationship and who doesn't need other dogs to provide entertainment for King. Like most kings, our King could use a governing body to keep him from indulging his excesses. If you think you could be a leader strong enough to govern a King, then there may be a ""happily ever after in this guy's future. ",TRUE,"**Interview with His Royal Highness, King**

**Interviewer:** Well, well, well! We have the magnificent King here with us today. So, King, tell us about your royal blue coat!

**King:** Ah, yes! The illustrious blue... It’s like the ocean, but fluffier! Sure, I have a few lumps and bald spots—think of them as battle scars from my noble adventures! Pressure sores? Pfft! Just me earning my royal stripes!

**Interviewer:** I heard you were transferred from a shelter in New Jersey. What’s that story?

**King:** Oh, you know how it goes—one day you're someone’s buddy, and the next day, you're on a quest for a new castle. Apparently, I had a little ruckus with my fellow canine subjects. Turns out, I've got more of a royal “solo act” vibe!

**Interviewer:** Speaking of solo, what do you think about being an only dog?

**King:** Only dog? Sign me up! I’m all about the one-dog show! Less barking, more bonding. Puppy parties? No thanks! I’d rather have my human focused on me—and my treats!

**Interviewer:** What kind of home do you think you need?

**King:** An adults-only kingdom, where I can reign supreme, but also receive some training. I need a human who can keep my royal opinions in check—firm but fun! 

**Interviewer:** Any final thoughts for your future subjects?

**King:** If you're ready to embrace my kingly ways, you could be part of my “happily ever after.” Together, we can conquer this thing called life—just remember to bring the treats! Long live friendship!","Hey there, noble subjects! The name's King, and I'm here to take the throne of your heart! I’m a big blue boy with floppy ears that could tingle the heartstrings of even the grumpiest of folk! When I spot my favorite humans, my tail goes into full-on wag mode—it’s like a happy little metronome of joy!

Now, as for my royal appearance, I may have a couple of lumps and bald spots—think of them as my battle scars from a life well-lived. I've come from a shelter in New Jersey, where I learned a thing or two about being picky with my pals. I’m not just a pup; I'm a one-man canine show! You see, while I love hoarding my toys like a true King, my royal decree states that I should be the only dog in the castle. Sailors may have dog fights, but I prefer to keep my reputation as the solo superstar, thank you very much!

I’ll admit I’ve picked up some ""kingly"" traits from my kennel buddies, which means I’m a rough-and-tumble kind of guy who thrives on love and fun—with a side of structure. A home that is all about humans (no furry rivals, please!) sounds like the perfect royal abode for me. I promise to bring laughter and companionship, but I do need my subjects to provide training and guidance so I can maintain my regal composure. 

So, if you think you can handle a mighty King and keep me entertained without a bunch of other pups around, then let’s talk happily ever after! It’s time to rule together, one belly rub at a time! 👑🐾","🌟 **Meet King: The Majestic Blue Gentle Giant!** 🌟

**Introduction:** This big blue boy, affectionately known as King, is a striking presence with his floppy cropped ears and a wagging docked tail that dances with joy when he spots his favorite humans. Though he’s a gentle giant, King is in need of a special throne—a forever home where he can truly thrive.

**Background Story:** Transferred from a shelter in New Jersey, King was brought in after being surrendered by an owner due to conflicts with another dog. While the details of his prior life remain a mystery, it's clear that King needs a dedicated owner who understands his unique needs. 

**Health & Wellness:** King's blue coat is mostly in good shape, though he does have a couple of lumps and bald spots—likely pressure sores that will heal in the comfort of his own castle. With love and care, we know he will flourish.

**Personality Traits:** King is a spirited and playful pup, showcasing traits reminiscent of his bully breed companions. He enjoys carrying his toys around and displays a limitless enthusiasm for his human friends. However, he does not play well with other dogs, so his regal nature requires a throne free from canine competition.

**Ideal Home:** King is searching for a dedicated, adults-only household where he can reign as the one and only dog. He’ll thrive best with owners who are willing to invest in training, teaching him to express himself in a respectful manner. As many adult male Dobermans do, King benefits from a structured routine and a balanced mix of work and play—other dogs won’t be needed to keep him entertained.

**Calling All Leaders:** If you believe you have the strength and consistency to guide this majestic fellow, King is ready for his “happily ever after.” Together, you can create a harmonious kingdom filled with love, respect, and joyful companionship.

**Caine:** Oh, yes! I can be a bit of a drama king when it comes to other dogs on leash. They’re like uninvited guests at my party. I’d much rather meet them face to face after an enthusiastic ‘hello!’

**Interviewer:** How do you feel about little humans?

**Caine:** Let's just say I prefer my playdates with adults or older kids. With my exuberance, I could turn a calm afternoon into a doggy circus show!

**Interviewer:** What’s your favorite thing about your time at DRU?

**Caine:** The attention! Who doesn’t love a good belly rub? I’m just waiting for that special someone who appreciates my energetic charm. Adopt me, and let’s create our own fun adventures!","Hey, party people! I’m Caine—a devilishly handsome, 3-year-old red tornado in a dog suit! 📅✨ I may have started my journey in a mysterious past at a shelter in New York, but now I’m on a mission to find my forever home where I can share my wild spirit and boundless energy! 

I’m like a furry battery pack—charge me up with some playtime and watch me zoom around in my fenced-in kingdom. Walks? Nah, too mainstream for an adventurous hound like me! My leash manners could use a little polishing (hey, I get excited when I see my fellow pups), so I guess you could call me a 'reactive' dog when I’m on a leash. But get me off-leash in a safe place, and it's pure fun! 🎉🐾

I’ll happily show off my basic obedience skills—I've got tricks up my fur to impress you! Chains of childhood bonding may just bring a bit too much boisterous energy for the little ones, so a home without younger children would be the dream spot for me. 

Attention from my human pals? Yes, please! I thrive on all those chin scratches and ear rubs; who doesn’t enjoy a little TLC? So if you're ready for a bundle of energy and zest for life, I could be the special one who brightens your days and fills your home with endless furry shenanigans! Let’s become the best adventure duo ever! 🚀❤️","🐾 **Introducing Caine: The Energetic Red Marvel!** 🐾

**Age:** Approximately 3 years  
**Coat:** Natural red beauty  

**Background:** Caine's journey brought him to DRU from a shelter in New York, and while his past remains a mystery, we’re excited to share what we know about this vibrant pup!

**Personality Power:** Caine is an incredibly friendly and outgoing dog with a high energy level that matches his zest for life. He thrives in a fun-filled, fenced area where he can play to his heart's content, as he prefers this over leisurely walks. 

**Quirks to Note:** While Caine has a playful and loving spirit, he can be a bit reactive to other dogs when on a leash. He is fully equipped with basic obedience skills and is always eager to show off what he knows. 

**Ideal Home:** We believe Caine would thrive in a home without young children due to his exuberance and playful nature. He seeks an active family that can give him the attention and playtime he craves. 

**Caine’s Wish:** This charming pup adores the affection of our staff and is ready to find his special someone who will appreciate his vibrant personality. Could that be you? If you're looking for a lively companion to join your adventures, Caine is waiting for you! Apply today to make him a part of your family!"

Despite the hardships he's faced, Scooby-Doo's spirit remains unbroken, and he's now seeking that special Doberman Savvy home where he can truly thrive. This charming pup has a lot to offer. He values companionship and enjoys the company of those who understand his unique needs. Scooby-Doo's recall skills are top-notch when there are no distractions, but there's a bit of the adventurer in him, too. His prey drive means he can't resist the temptation to chase after rabbits and other small animals, so a securely fenced yard is a must. One thing to note: Scooby-Doo has a strict ""no cats allowed"" policy, so a feline-free home is a must. In a quiet home where there's someone around most of the time, Scooby-Doo thrives. He's comfortable with being crated for a few hours if needed. Scooby-Doo is selective about his people, but once he's chosen you, you'll have a loyal companion. Scooby-Doo has a few special dietary requirements. He needs a low-fat diet to stay healthy, as high-fat foods tend to upset his stomach and. Additionally, he takes fluoxetine to manage some anxious behaviors that arise when he's left alone.

**Interviewer:** Hello Scooby-Doo! You’ve had quite the adventure so far. How are you feeling today?

**Scooby-Doo:** Hmm, better than a squirrel at a dog park! I mean, I’ve bounced back from a rough start, but let’s just say, things could’ve been a little more... plush! 

**Interviewer:** It sounds like you’re looking for a special home. What kind of place suits your royal needs?

**Scooby-Doo:** Oh, I’m a picky prince! A tranquil castle where the humans are Doberman-savvy is where I’ll thrive. No noisy neighbors or curious cats! Leave those furballs out of my kingdom, please.

**Interviewer:** You’re quite the expert at playing hard to get. What’s your ideal human like?

**Scooby-Doo:** They need to understand my quirks and give neck scratches worthy of royalty! Once you’re in my circle, you’re my loyal subject for life. Just remember, I take my throne seriously... and my snacks too!

**Interviewer:** And what about that adventurous side? I hear you’ve got a bit of a prey drive?

**Scooby-Doo:** Oh, absolutely! Rabbits are my personal enemies. If I see one, it’s game on! A securely fenced yard is a MUST. Gotta keep my kingdom safe!

**Interviewer:** I hear you have some special dietary requirements?

**Scooby-Doo:** Yup, low-fat food, please! High-fat is a no-go for this tummy. And a little fluoxetine helps when I feel on edge. Change is hard for a Dobe like me!

I’m on the lookout for a special human who knows their Doberman stuff (that's you, by the way!)—someone who can appreciate a dog with a flair for companionship! I mean, sure, I have my sniffs and sometimes go full-on ‘super sleuth’ mode chasing after the local bunny brigade, but who could resist a little adventure? Just make sure my yard is securely fenced, or those rabbits are going to have one heck of a chase on their paws!

Now, let’s talk about my cat policy: strictly “no cats allowed!” That’s right; I’m a dog on a mission and felines have to be kept at bay! I heartily believe in “dog people” family vibes only! 

I do enjoy a bit of quiet in my life, so a calm home where my human is around most of the time would be ideal for me. I’m perfectly cool with being crated for a few hours if you’ve got some errands to run—you do your thing, and I’ll keep an eye on the couch. When it comes to people, I'm a bit selective, but once you earn my trust, you’ve got yourself a loyal sidekick for life!

I have a few special dietary demands—low-fat food is the name of the game for me. High-fat foods? Well, let’s just say they don’t sit well with me, and I prefer to keep my energy levels high and my tummy happy.

Because of this, he would thrive best in a household without other pets or children, although he has successfully cohabited with a female Doberman in the past.

At just six months old, he underwent cataract surgery for a severe eye condition. Unfortunately, his owners did not follow through with the treatment plan, leaving him visually impaired. Subsequently, they surrendered him to a Doberman rescue in Florida in January 2022, noting 'failed eye surgery.' In April of that year, the closure of the Florida rescue provided the opportunity for Basil to transfer to DRU. Under the care of a veterinary ophthalmology specialist, Basil started a regimen of two types of eyedrops, administered twice daily, with hopes of improving his vision. Unfortunately, the damage to his left eye was severe, necessitating its removal. Although he retains some vision in his right eye, Basil will require lifelong medical treatment. Despite the challenges he has faced at such a young age, Basil's spirit remains resilient. His vision issues and unique needs make him a special case, seeking a home that can provide him with the understanding and care he requires. He thrives in a calm environment and would do best as the only dog, with an owner experienced in handling Dobermans and willing to continue with his medical treatment plan.

I like to think I’m hitting the ‘one-eyed Wonder’ vibe!

**Interviewer:** So, what’s life like for you now, Basil?

**Basil:** Well, I’m living the dream – mostly. The ideal home for me? Calm, patient, and ideally sans other canine buddies. I’ve got some quirks from my SSNAP status that need accommodating. 

**Interviewer:** Any special requirements for your potential family?
