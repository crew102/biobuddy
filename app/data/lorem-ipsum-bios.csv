Henry is very loving and loves his belly rubbed. Henry is dog selective and would require a meet and greet. Henry is good with kids but would do best with kids 10 and older. Henry would need a home where he can decompress from being in a shelter environment. He loves to go for rides and play ball. Henry will need an experienced owner who can correct him when he needs it. He will be going to training in February for a month hopefully we can get him in sooner. When you come to the humane society to visit Henry he is very crate reactive and does not show his best personality as most of our big dogs are like that. Henry needs someone to give him a home with no cats or small dogs. He will also require a fence.

**Interviewer:** Hey, Henry! It's a pleasure to meet a distinguished house hippo such as yourself. What makes you the lovable character everyone talks about?

**Henry:** Hey there! Well, if you love belly rubs and a good cuddle session, then I'm your guy. I've got a belly that's basically a VIP lounge. Rub it, and I'll be your best friend.

**Interviewer:** It says here you‚Äôre a bit particular with your doggy friends. True?

**Henry:** Guilty as charged! I'm selective about my canine buddies. A meet and greet is a must to ensure we vibe well together. Think of it as my personal audition process.

**Interviewer:** How do you feel about kids?

**Henry:** Kids are great, especially the ones aged 10 and up. The little ones are cool too, but I think I'd do best with older kids who understand my need for some personal space and occasional 'me time.'

**Interviewer:** Let's talk hobbies. What's a day in the life of Henry like?

**Henry:** Car rides and ball games, baby! I love feeling the wind in my fur and chasing a good ball. It's my cardio and my fun all rolled into one.

**Interviewer:** You mentioned needing a bit of decompression time. What's your ideal home environment?

**Henry:** After my time at the shelter, I need a calm, peaceful home to relax and adjust. No cats or small dogs, please. And a secure fence would be fantastic for my sunbathing and playtime.

**Interviewer:** You're heading to training soon, right?

**Henry:** Yep! I'm going pro in behavior and obedience training this February. I‚Äôll come back even more polished and ready to charm my new family.

**Interviewer:** Anything else future adopters should know?

**Henry:** Just that I'm crate reactive at the shelter, so don't judge me based on that. Trust me, my true charm shines outside those bars. Ready for a loyal, belly-rub-loving companion? I‚Äôm your guy!

**Interviewer:** Thanks for the chat, Henry! For anyone interested in adopting Henry, visit the Humane Society this Saturday from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm at 810 Carl Vinson Parkway, Centerville, GA, or fill out an application on our website.

**Henry:** Can‚Äôt wait to meet my forever family!","Hey there, cool humans! I'm Henry, your soon-to-be favorite house hippo! If you're searching for a loving buddy with a serious penchant for belly rubs, then look no further because I'm your guy!

Now, let's cut to the chase - I'm a bit picky about my doggy friends, so I'm all about that 'meet and greet' life. Kids? Oh, I do adore them, but I‚Äôd prefer my tiny human pals to be 10 years old or older. Gotta keep things safe and fun, right? Shelter life has been a roller-coaster, so I‚Äôd need a cozy spot where I can relax and shake off the shelter vibes. 

One of my favorite pastimes is cruising in the car - wind in my fur, ears flapping, the works. And don‚Äôt even get me started on playing ball! I'm like a pro athlete when it comes to fetch. But hey, I need an experienced owner who can keep me in check ‚Äì you know, the whole 'firm but loving' routine. Good news is, I'm heading to a training bootcamp soon, so I'll be polishing up my good boy skills!

Heads up though, I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of crates ‚Äì they make me show my cranky side. And as a proud big dog, I say 'no, thank you' to cats and small dogs. Oh, and a fenced yard is non-negotiable ‚Äì a hippo needs his space to roam, after all!

Quick run-down of the cool perks if you adopt me: I come neutered (when I'm old enough), microchipped, and fully vetted with up-to-date vaccines and deworming.

**About Henry:**
Henry is the epitome of a cuddly companion! This affectionate boy adores belly rubs and relishes moments of relaxation. While he is a sweetheart, Henry can be dog selective, so a meet and greet is essential for potential canine siblings.

**Family Fit:**
Henry is great with kids, though he would thrive best in a home with children aged 10 and older. After his time in the shelter, Henry needs a peaceful space to decompress and unwind. A home where he can enjoy car rides and play fetch will make him happiest.

**Special Requirements:**
- **Experienced Owner:** Henry requires a seasoned pet parent who can provide firm yet loving guidance.
- **Cat-Free Zone:** No cats or small dogs, please.
- **Secure Environment:** A fenced yard is a must to ensure Henry's safety and freedom to play.
- **Ongoing Training:** Henry is scheduled for a month of training in February, but we hope to start sooner to help him become his best self. Keep in mind, Henry might not show his true, wonderful personality in the crate during your visit, as this environment makes him reactive, similar to many larger dogs.

**Shotzie:** Oh, where do I start? Running laps in the yard is my jam! And don't even get me started on jolly ball or splashing around in a kiddie pool. Summer just isn't complete without a good soak.

**Interviewer:** I heard you have a special friend at the shelter named Russell. What's your friendship secret?

**Shotzie:** Russell‚Äôs my homie! We mesh well because he's laid-back, and I bring the party. It‚Äôs all about balance, you know?

**Interviewer:** You're quite the socialite! So, what kind of home would suit you best?

**Interviewer:** Any tips for your new family when it comes to introducing you to new settings and people?

**Shotzie:** Slow and steady wins the race! Give me a little time to suss things out. With patience and love, I'll be your loyal whirlwind of joy in no time.

**Interviewer:** Parting words for your potential forever family?

**Shotzie:** Ready to live life in the fast lane? If you can keep up with me, I promise endless fun, laughter, and a whole lot of love. Let‚Äôs do this!","Hey there, future family! I'm Shotzie, the pint-sized tornado of fun you've been waiting for! I may have left my last home because my energy was, well, a bit too fabulous to handle, but I'm ready to bring my zest for life to someone who can keep up!

Imagine a blur of fur racing around the yard - that's me, in my natural habitat! Whether it's chasing a jolly ball or splashing around in a kiddie pool during summer, I'm always up for a good time. Got a playful pup at home? Awesome! I could totally use a buddy like Russell, my BFF at the shelter. An adult human crew who can appreciate my spirited nature would be ideal. 

I need to take my time settling into new places and meeting new folks - they say I'm all about that ""slow and steady wins the race"" approach when it comes to introductions. And, one more thing - I prefer a feline-free home, thank you very much.

King's blue coat is in fairly good condition although he does have a couple of lumps and bald spots, most likely pressure sores that will hopefully improve once he's in a comfortable castle of his own. Transferred from a shelter in New Jersey, King was originally turned in to them by an owner who reported that he was fighting with another dog in the house. Although we have no other details from his original home, the NJ shelter confirmed that King's intolerance of other dogs was real. They sent him to DRU in order to help him find Dobe-savvy owners through our program. King is a very big, rough and tumble guy. Sometimes it seems as though he'd picked up some of the traits of the bully breeds who were his most common kennelmates at the other shelter: he is very happy to carry his toys around, he loves his people enthusiastically and then there's that ""not cool with other dogs thing. Perhaps he has taken his name too literally all this time and feels the need to go forth and conquer? We think King would thrive in a home where his owners would respect his opinions without allowing him to express them. In other words, King needs to be an only dog in an adults-only home and owned by people who are willing to continue training him and teaching him to keep those opinions to himself. As is the case with the majority of adult male Dobermans, King is not a daycare/dog park/puppy party guy. He needs and deserves an owner who will provide him with both the structure of training and the fun of a work/play relationship and who doesn't need other dogs to provide entertainment for King. Like most kings, our King could use a governing body to keep him from indulging his excesses. If you think you could be a leader strong enough to govern a King, then there may be a ""happily ever after in this guy's future. ",TRUE,"**A Royal Dialogue with King, The Majestic Blue Doberman**

**Interviewer:** Ladies and gentlemen, we are graced today by none other than King, the regal blue Doberman. King, how‚Äôs royal life treating you?

**King:** *Woof!* Royal life? More like royal duties! Keeping my humans entertained, especially with my cropped ears and floppy style. They love the tail wags too; think of it as my royal wave!

**Interviewer:** Your coat is quite striking! I've heard you‚Äôve come a long way from New Jersey.

**King:** Oh, yes, the Garden State! My blue coat isn't without its battle scars and pressure sores, but nothing a cozy castle can‚Äôt fix. I‚Äôm ready for my throne, thank you very much.

**Interviewer:** It's been mentioned you're not a fan of other dogs. Can you elaborate on that royal decree?

**King:** Ah, the ‚Äòno other dogs‚Äô edict! Let‚Äôs just say I cherish my space and my humans. I‚Äôm a solo act, like a rock star on tour. Other dogs? Not my scene.

**Interviewer:** Word has it, you‚Äôve got some energy and a bit of a bully breed vibe. Care to comment?

**King:** Rough and tumble, that‚Äôs me! I‚Äôve spent time with the toughest crowd, so now I carry my toys like a scepter and rule with enthusiasm. But hey, we all have our quirks.

**Interviewer:** What is your ideal kingdom like?

**King:** Adults-only, please‚Äîfits my sophistication. I‚Äôm looking for humans who understand my royal ways and don‚Äôt mind a bit of training and structure. Think of it as guiding a king.

**Interviewer:** Any messages for potential subjects, I mean, owners?

**King:** Prepare for a life of loyalty, fun, and a bit of discipline. If you can handle my royal highness, we‚Äôll create a regal happily-ever-after. Ready to take the throne with me?

**Interviewer:** Well, there you have it, folks! King is in search of his perfect royal court. Do you have what it takes to be part of his kingdom?","Hear ye, hear ye! Introducing King, your future royal bestie with a coat of blue and a regal wag of his docked tail! I may look like a tough guy with my cropped ears that flop, but underneath it all, I'm just a big loveable doofus who needs his own castle. I came all the way from a shelter in New Jersey, and while I had a bit of a kerfuffle with another canine in my previous kingdom, I'm ready to reign in a new, dog-free domain.

I have a few lumps and some bald spots‚Äîthink of them as royal battle scars‚Äîbut no need to worry, they're just pressure sores that'll improve once I'm lounging on my royal cushions. Let's get one thing clear: I'm not really into dog social circles. Other dogs are not my court! They say I take my name a bit too seriously, feeling the need to conquer, but hey, a king‚Äôs gotta do what a king‚Äôs gotta do!

I'm a big, rough-and-tumble guy who loves to carry my toys around and lavish my people with royal affection. While I may exhibit some traits of bully breeds (my former kennelmates), my heart is in the right place. I get it, I have ‚Äòopinions‚Äô and sometimes I express them too freely. That's why I need a kingdom with no other dogs and adult subjects only, ruled by someone who will train me while also making our work and playtimes epic.

I‚Äôm not the daycare or dog park type; I prefer one-on-one time with my loyal subjects. What I really need is a strong leader who can govern this King and help me stick to the royal code of conduct.

Despite some lumps and bald spots‚Äîlikely pressure sores that should improve with some royal treatment‚ÄîKing‚Äôs magnificent blue coat showcases his noble heritage.

**Past Adventures:** King‚Äôs journey began in New Jersey, where he was surrendered by an owner due to conflicts with another dog in the household. The shelter verified this behavior and transferred him to us to find Dobe-experienced owners who can provide King with the kingdom he deserves.

**Royal Attributes:**
1. **Loyal Companion**: King shows unwavering loyalty to his people, always ready to share his joy and carry his toys around with enthusiasm.
2. **Independent Spirit**: While he treasures his human companions, he‚Äôs not fond of sharing his realm with other dogs. This unique trait makes him perfect for a dog-free household.
3. **Majestic Presence**: With a robust and spirited demeanor, he sometimes mirrors the resilience of the bully breeds he encountered in his previous shelter.

**Ideal Kingdom:** King needs a home where his sovereign opinions are respected but managed. He‚Äôll flourish in an adults-only environment, free from other dogs, under the guidance of owners committed to his ongoing training and development. His ideal guardians will provide a balance of structure and playful engagement, focusing solely on him.

**Royal Decree:** King is not suited for daycare, dog parks, or puppy parties. Instead, he seeks a dedicated owner who values his regal nature and provides structured support‚Äîa guiding hand to help him channel his strength and loyalty.

Like many dogs in this situation, Howard perhaps perceived himself as the ""baby"" of the family and reacted as a jealous older sibling when a human child arrived. Despite their year-long wait and hope for Howard's adjustment, he regrettably became more challenging to live with. He began marking the baby's belongings, defending furniture, and intensifying his territorial behavior. The choice to rehome him through DRU was a heavy one for his former family, who initially welcomed him as a lifelong member. In the early days here, Howard appeared confused and slow to trust. However, as he's settled in, we've witnessed his affectionate side slowly emerging. Once he warms up to a new human friend, Howard becomes highly enthusiastic and responsive. A simple offering of a hot dog elicits swift obedience and eye contact that grows softer and more trusting with each passing day. While he may still assess your credentials upon your first meeting, he's becoming a bit more welcoming to new members of ""Club Howard."" In the kennel, Howard is often found snuggled up in his favorite comforter, yet he'll eagerly spring into action for quality time with his beloved humans. Howard remains a work in progress.

**Howard:** Well, let's say I found myself in a bit of a ""ruff"" patch. My previous family had a human baby, and I felt like my ""top dog"" status was threatened. I might've acted like a jealous older sibling ‚Äì marking belongings and getting a little too territorial. They loved me but decided it was best to find me a new home.

**Interviewer:** It must have been hard for both you and them. How have you been adjusting?

**Howard:** At first, I was puzzled. ""Why am I here? Where‚Äôs my peanut butter?"" But the folks here gave me time. Now, I‚Äôm starting to show my affectionate side again. Give me a hot dog, and I'm your new best friend!

He originally came from a high-euthanasia shelter in SC after being seized from a neglectful situation. A shelter in RI stepped in to save Hank, who arrived nervous and emaciated. Subsequently, they reached out to DRU, hoping to give him a better chance of finding a home with a family experienced in caring for Dobermans. Hank experiences medical issues commonly associated with dilute Dobermans. His eyes, which are blue, are highly sensitive to light, and he prefers wearing goggles for protection. Additionally, he deals with skin allergies and benign growths. Recently, he underwent an abscess debridement procedure. Hank loves his DRU caretakers, but earning his trust wasn't easy. He will require a slow introduction to potential adopters and a few meet-and-greets to ensure a good fit. Hank has a high prey drive, as indicated by an incident where he killed a rabbit at the previous shelter. While he enjoys going on walks and behaves well with other dogs on a leash, we prefer that Hank goes to a home as the only dog, ensuring he receives the focused attention needed to keep him safe. Hank adores his toys and needs a quiet space where he can settle and unwind. Due to a reported previous bite incident, the ideal home for Hank would be with Doberman-savvy adults, no children, as the only dog, and with no small animals.

**Hank:** Hey there! It's been a wild ride, but I'm hanging in there. Got my goggles on, ready to take on the world with style!

**Interviewer:** Speaking of those goggles, they look pretty cool. Can you tell us why you wear them?

**Hank:** Oh, these? Pure fashion statement... and by fashion, I mean function. My blue eyes are like sensitive superpower detectors. The goggles help me feel like a canine superhero, ready to save the day without squinting at the light.

**Interviewer:** I hear you've had some medical challenges. How do you manage to stay so upbeat?

**Hank:** Well, I've got a few quirks‚Äîskin allergies, benign growths, and the occasional elaborate surgery. But my caretakers at DRU have been awesome, and treats do wonders for the soul. Plus, snuggling with my toys is the best medicine.

**Interviewer:** Building trust has been a journey for you. Any advice for potential adopters?

**Hank:** Think of me like the fine wine of Dobermans‚ÄîI need time to uncork and breathe. A few meet-and-greets to let me sniff you out, and we'll be tight. Think patience and belly rubs.

**Interviewer:** Let's talk hobbies! I hear you‚Äôre a fan of walks and toys.

**Hank:** Oh, absolutely! Walks are my jam, and toys? They‚Äôre my treasure. Give me a quiet space to chill with my toy stash, and I‚Äôm a happy Hank.

**Interviewer:** What‚Äôs the ideal home for you, buddy?

**Hank:** I‚Äôm looking for a Doberman-savvy home with adults, no kiddos, and no other pets. I need my humans all to myself. Think you‚Äôre up for it? I promise to repay you with loyalty, love, and loads of Doberman charm.

- **Building Trust**: Hank loves his DRU caretakers, but winning his heart took time. A slow introduction with potential adopters, involving several meet-and-greets, is essential for a lasting bond.
- **High Prey Drive**: A previous incident where he killed a rabbit suggests a strong prey instinct, making a home without small animals ideal.
- **Solo Star**: While Hank enjoys walks and can interact well with other dogs on a leash, he should be the only pet in the household, ensuring he gets the focused attention he deserves.

This handsome canine is a bundle of energy and is seeking a dedicated and experienced owner who can provide him with the structured environment he craves.

Beau has had his share of ups and downs. He was adopted once but was returned due to his high energy levels. While he's a delightful companion, it's important to note that he does experience some anxiety. Because of this, he would thrive best in a household without other pets or children, although he has successfully cohabited with a female Doberman in the past. Beau's strong prey drive and his obsession with chasing squirrels, and being on guard 24/7 requires a dedicated owner who can handle his unique needs.

",FALSE,"**Interview with Beau, The Red-Hot Doberman Dynamo**

**Interviewer:** Hi Beau! Thanks for taking a break from your busy schedule to chat with us. First things first, what's your favorite way to spend a day?

**Beau:** Oh, easy! Running, playing, and some serious squirrel surveillance. If you're looking for a jogging buddy who doubles as a security detail, I'm your guy!

**Interviewer:** I've heard you've got some strong feelings about travel. Care to elaborate?

**Beau:** Ugh, don't get me started on cars. I mean, what's up with all those other vehicles? Barking is my way of saying, ""Stay in your lane, buddy!""

**Interviewer:** You seem like a dog who knows what he wants. What kind of home are you looking for?

**Beau:** I'd love a place with structure and someone who gets me. I'm high-energy and need an owner who's experienced and can keep up. No kids or other pets, though. Been there, done that, prefer my peace and quiet.

**Interviewer:** So, about that prey drive‚Äîsquirrels, huh?

**Beau:** Oh, squirrels are my nemesis! They think they're so clever, darting around. But once I'm on patrol, nothing escapes my watchful eyes.

**Interviewer:** You've faced some challenges. Any words for a future owner?

**Beau:** Look, I'm a handful but worth every ounce of effort. If you're dedicated to my training and can provide an anxiety-free environment, I'll be your most loyal and entertaining companion ever.

At just six months old, he underwent cataract surgery for a severe eye condition. Unfortunately, his owners did not follow through with the treatment plan, leaving him visually impaired. Subsequently, they surrendered him to a Doberman rescue in Florida in January 2022, noting 'failed eye surgery.' In April of that year, the closure of the Florida rescue provided the opportunity for Basil to transfer to DRU. Under the care of a veterinary ophthalmology specialist, Basil started a regimen of two types of eyedrops, administered twice daily, with hopes of improving his vision. Unfortunately, the damage to his left eye was severe, necessitating its removal. Although he retains some vision in his right eye, Basil will require lifelong medical treatment. Despite the challenges he has faced at such a young age, Basil's spirit remains resilient. His vision issues and unique needs make him a special case, seeking a home that can provide him with the understanding and care he requires. He thrives in a calm environment and would do best as the only dog, with an owner experienced in handling Dobermans and willing to continue with his medical treatment plan. Additionally, his new owner should be prepared to accommodate his behavioral quirks that come with being a SSNAP Dog. ",FALSE,"**Spotlight Interview with Basil, The Indomitable Spirit**

**Interviewer:** Hello, Basil! You've got quite the story. Can you share a bit about your journey?

**Basil:** Bark! Of course! It all started with eye troubles at six months. Cataract surgery didn't go as planned, and my previous humans couldn't keep up with the treatment. So, I ended up with a Doberman rescue in Florida.

**Interviewer:** That sounds tough. How did you end up here?

**Basil:** In April 2022, the Florida rescue closed, and I got transferred to DRU. They took me to an eye specialist who gave me super-special eyedrops. Sadly, my left eye was too far gone and had to be removed, but I still see a bit with my right one.

**Interviewer:** That's quite a journey. How do you stay so positive?

**Basil:** I'm a glass-half-full kinda dog! Even with one eye, I get around just fine. I love sniffing adventures and the occasional treat hunt. Plus, I‚Äôve got a master‚Äôs degree in ""cuddleology.""

**Interviewer:** What's the perfect home for you?

**Basil:** I need a calm environment where I can be the center of attention‚Äîno doggy siblings, please. My new human should be a Doberman pro and ready to keep up with my medical routine. I promise to repay them with endless loyalty and a few well-earned nuzzles.

**Interviewer:** Any advice for your future family?

**Basil:** Be patient, love me lots, and keep those eyedrops coming. Together, we can turn every day into a tail-wagging adventure!

","Hey there, future forever friend! I'm Basil, your soon-to-be favorite one-eyed wonder! My life started out a bit rocky, but don't let that fool you‚ÄîI‚Äôm as resilient as they come. At just six months, I had cataract surgery that didn‚Äôt turn out too well, but hey, who needs perfect vision when you've got charm like mine? After a whirlwind journey from Florida to DRU, I‚Äôm now a proud SSNAP Dog, and believe me, I've got stories to tell.

Sure, I might have only one eye and need a couple of special eyedrops twice a day, but that just means there's more of me to love and care for! My left eye may have called it quits, but my right eye is hanging in there, making me the perfect mix of pirate and pup. Arrr, matey!

I thrive in a serene and loving environment‚ÄîI‚Äôm a bit of a zen master, you could say. I prefer to be the star of the show, so being the only dog suits me just fine. Plus, if you've got experience with Dobermans, we'll get along like peanut butter and jelly! My ideal human would be someone who's ready to stick to my treatment plan and can handle my quirky, charming self.

Despite everything, my spirit is bright, and I'm ready to fill your life with tail wags, doggy kisses, and loyal companionship.

Surrendered to a Doberman rescue in Florida in January 2022, he faced an uncertain future, labeled with 'failed eye surgery.'
