<original_bio id="example-1">
red is a classic dachshund - very affectionate, follows you around, naps a lot, but he's also very calm and sweet around new people. red is a world-class snuggler - refusing to be anywhere except against your body when he sleeps. he also is clearly a hound-forward dachshund, as he loves sniffing around on the ground during walks looking for food. red loves belly rubs, is food motivated, and is house trained. he has puppy engery at times but does well when he's well-exercised.

Hey there, potential best friend! I'm Red, a champion in the fine art of cuddling and specializing in constant companionship. Be it sprawling out on the couch or taking a stroll in the park, I'm always happiest when I'm next to my favorite human. I practically invented the term "snuggle-buddy"! Nighttime is the best, seriously, I could be awarded a grand prize for my world-class snuggling abilities. 

You'll find I possess a trait quite typical of my breed, the noble Dachshund - a passion for sniff outs! I'm like the Sherlock Holmes of food - I love putting my hound prowess to the test during walks, eagerly sniffing at the ground in search of culinary delights. (A word of warning: If it's there, I'll find it!) 

Food is not just a necessityâ€”it's the light of my life! Seriously, is there anything better than a good belly rub after a savory meal? I think not. Talking about belly rubs, the way to my heart is through my belly! I'm up for belly rubs anytime, anywhere. Of course, being a well-mannered gentleman, I am potty trained and always remember to mind my manners indoors. 

Even though I love a good siesta, don't let my calm demeanor fool you. I can match the best of the puppies with my energy bursts (after a good walk or run, of course)! So if you are hoping to add a whole lot of love, fun, and doggy charisma to your life, look no further!
