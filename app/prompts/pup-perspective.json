Be it sprawling out on the couch or taking a stroll in the park, I'm always happiest when I'm next to my favorite human. I practically invented the term \"snuggle-buddy\"! Nighttime is the best, seriously, I could be awarded a grand prize for my world-class snuggling abilities. \n\nYou'll find I possess a trait quite typical of my breed, the noble Dachshund - a passion for sniff outs! I'm like the Sherlock Holmes of food - I love putting my hound prowess to the test during walks, eagerly sniffing at the ground in search of culinary delights. (A word of warning: If it's there, I'll find it!) \n\nFood is not just a necessityâ€”it's the light of my life! Seriously, is there anything better than a good belly rub after a savory meal? I think not. Talking about belly rubs, the way to my heart is through my belly! I'm up for belly rubs anytime, anywhere. Of course, being a well-mannered gentleman, I am potty trained and always remember to mind my manners indoors. \n\nEven though I love a good siesta, don't let my calm demeanor fool you. I can match the best of the puppies with my energy bursts (after a good walk or run, of course)! So if you are hoping to add a whole lot of love, fun, and doggy charisma to your life, look no further!"
